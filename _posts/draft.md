The last few months were tiring. I hardly got any time for writing. I was busy
preparing content for a workshop and talk. Hopefully I will get into my flow
soon. In this post I will try to answer one of the most important question of
our life, “Employment!”. At conferences, IRC channels or even by the roadside, I
had requested people to suggest good employment opportunities for me. I have not
always been very lucky in finding greener pastures. I am writing this blog post
so that you learn from my poor experience. I am happy that at least I was able
to knock the door of good companies. I am sharing a list of portals and
companies that I am following or have followed in last few years. As a bonus
point, I will highlight some uncommon ways which helped me to invite new
opportunities.  You should read this post if you are looking for **Python + web
+ (remote OR India)** related employment.

*Disclaimer: I have not taken any money or any other type of bribes to advertise
companies here.*

### Strongly recommended

#### [Python Job board](https://www.python.org/jobs/)

This website is the best choice for finding jobs in Python. The portal is
managed by volunteers from the Python Software Foundation. You can find both
remote and on-site visa sponsored jobs here. You will get an option to subscribe
via RSS feeds. They have an active Twitter handle too. I have configured
[IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to drop me an email whenever new feeds are
published.

#### Mailing lists

Mailing lists are a good source to get notified for new job openings. In India,
there are a few active mailing lists managed by volunteers of that community.
Often Job emails are tagged with "[JOB]" in the subject. I have configured my
mail client to collect all the mails with "[JOB]" in their subject in a
dedicated folder of my mail client. This configuration helps me to pay steady
attention to them. Your Hack May Vary.

Below is a list of active Python communities of India.

* [Bangalore](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/bangpypers)
* [Chennai](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/chennaipy)
* [Delhi](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/ncr-python.in)
* [Hyderabad](https://groups.google.com/group/hyderabadpython)
* [Kerala](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/python-kerala)
* [Pune](http://pune.python.org.in/index.html)

#### [HasJobs](https://hasjob.co/)

HasJob is an easy to follow job portal. You will find jobs posted by emerging to
well-established startups of India. I am following HasJobs since day one of my
career. During my early days, I used to run a
[bot](https://github.com/ultimatecoder/hasjobbot) to apply to all the latest
openings of the day. I am not using that tool now, but if you are interested in
making that bot compatible with the new HasJob, please create an issue
[here](https://github.com/ultimatecoder/hasjobbot/issues) to show your interest.
I am happy to hack on this project again.

#### [Python now](https://www.pythonnow.com/)

This job board is less known, but I find it effective for remote or visa
sponsored positions. Openings are mostly from companies based out of Europe or
United states.

#### [Github profile](https://github.com/ultimatecoder)

There were a good amount of invitations from recruiters, employers via my Github
profile. While Github jobs has not helped me much, this worked for me. I would
recommend adding your email address on your Github profile. It helps people to
reach out to you. In my case, most of the Github invitations for employment were
targeted to a common audience.  May be people are crawling Github profiles from
popular open source projects and sending them opportunity emails. I don't
consider anything wrong in the crawling way, but one should spend enough time in
identifying my expertise. Contributing to open source projects for inviting
better opportunities is a long subject which might be a good fit for an entire
blog post.

### Not so strongly recommended

#### [Django Gigs](https://djangogigs.com/)

I am not too much following this website, but I have followed this when I was
actively looking for a change. You will find openings for Django developer from
all around the world.

#### [OpenStack Jobs](https://www.openstack.org/community/jobs/)

OpenStack is a free and open source tool for cloud computing written in Python.
In my opinion, OpenStack is one another domain in Python. You should follow
this if you are interested in shaping your career in OpenStack.

#### [The free Python job board](http://pythonjobs.github.io/)

You will find openings from all domains of Python. Openings for remote developer
is less in proportion to on-site opportunities. I didn't notice any
opportunities by Indian tech companies at this portal.

#### [AngelList](https://angel.co)

I have heard from people, that AngelList works. It worked for me to observe
company culture, team and information about the investors of the company. I have
mixed experience with this portal. I was contacted by few employers for joining
their startups via AngelList, but they weren't so impressive. You should create
your Angle List profile and upgrade it periodically.

#### [HackerEarth](https://www.hackerearth.com/)

If you are looking for your first job or you are good at solving competitive
programming questions, then this platform can work for you. I have not followed
HackerEarth since almost 3-4 years. One thing is sure that once you create a
profile at this platform, they will spam you with emails of their hiring
challenges. You can obviously turn off email invitations from their platform.
My experience from those email invitations is that Hacker earth is good if you
want to get hired for large corporate.


### Popular, but I will not recommend them

#### [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com)

Most jobs were open from years. There are few openings which I had applied 2
years back, and they are still deciding whether to hire me or not. Some rejected
my application after 6 months. The employers don't bother to reply to my
questions. The openings which are flashed by the website are mostly inactive
years before. Subscription to new openings is even worse. Stackoverflow will
spam you for each and every opening despite you are only interested in watching
jobs from selective domain. Maybe you should have catchy Stackoverflow profile
(which I don't have) to get at least good response from the employer. I don't
think Stackoverflow should be the preferred choice to get employment at least in
India.

#### [LinkedIn with premium membership](https://premium.linkedin.com/)

LinkedIn works great for advertising your skills. I often use LinkedIn to
observe the employees of any company or finding the employment history of
anyone. I am contacted by a recruiter at least once a month which is a good
thing. But I had a poor experience of their premium service. It was total loss
of my money. I am recommending to have an updated LinkedIn profile that's it.
Premium services are more helpful to recruiters.

#### [Github jobs](https://jobs.github.com)

Github jobs has too many outdated jobs. It is not the recommended platform to
find an employment in India. I have stopped expecting good from this portal.

#### [Y Combinator](https://news.ycombinator.com/jobs)

This platform has mostly openings from Y Combinator startups. Companies posting
job openings are impressive, but there are very few openings for India or remote
for India based employee. I haven't got single invitation for an interview from
openings I applied via this website, but one fellow in my known has got employed
via this website. You should sure try your luck for sure.


### Network

#### [Twitter](https://twitter.com/jaysinhp)

Twitter is a great platform for find jobs, contract jobs, projects. Tweet that
you are looking for change in your employment. Add appropriate hashtags like
"#job #python" etc. I had pinned my "Looking for job" Tweet until I found
satisfied position. I had updated my profile description to "Looking for
interested position in Python Django..." to let people know that I am open to be
hired. I was contacted by lot of good people via Twitter. If you are new and you
don't have good network then you can find people having good influence in the
community and request them to re-tweet your "Looking for job" Tweet. Those
people can be organizer of any conference, meetup group, maintainer of any open
source project or known speaker of any technical conference. If you request them
politely, I am sure they will happy.

#### Facebook

Just like Twitter, Facebook also helped me to let people know that I am looking
for change. Facebook is kind of limited in networking with unknown people. I
have not tried posting on the walls of polular community pages, but there is
nothing wrong in following them if you are looking for any change.


#### Conferences

There are millions of advantages for attending any conference and this is one of
them. Conference has stalls managed by companies. You can visit them, talk with
them, ask questions about their culture, work pressure, kind of problem they are
trying to solve. When I was looking for job, I went to each and every stall of
Pycon and tried to talk with them. If I find them interesting, I go to their
career page and skim for openings matching to my skills. If I find any, I go
back to them and try to initiate a contact with the person by showing my
interest in openings at their company. Most of the time I was succeeded by
personal recommendations to their recruiter. Believe me, recommendation works
better than applying via online portals. Recruiter pays dedicated attention when
your profile is recommended by existing employee. If you are a good candidate,
people are happy to take you in their team.

You shouldn't be limited to stalls. You can check companies of speakers,
organizers or anyone you find interesting at the conference. LinkedIn works best
for skimming profiles and locate their employment details.

##### Job boards at conference

Job boards are interesting resource. You can demonstrate yourself that you are
looking for change and you can watch companies looking for employees. I prefer
to look the board at the end of the conference so that I get all possible
openings without re-looking. I scan profiles of companies, If they are doing I
don't delay in applying. I will advise to not take much time in applying to
positions you are interested in. You shouldn't assume you are the only one in
the race. Last year at Pycon India, we had an amazing response for job board.

* Pycon India Job board

![Pycon india job board]({{site.url}}/assets/images/python_jobs/pycon_india_job_board.jpg)

* [Pycon US](https://us.pycon.org/2019/sponsors/jobs/)

Pycon US has some remote openings for people located at anywhere on the earth.
It is worth scanning it once.

Below are list of conferences that I attended in past and found them helping for
finding better employment opportunities.

##### National

* [Pycon India](https://in.pycon.org/)
* [Devconf India](https://devconf.info/in)
* [JSFoo](https://jsfoo.in)
* [ReactFoo](https://reactfoo.in/)
* [FunctionalConf](https://functionalconf.com/)

##### Regional

* [PyDelhi Conf](https://conference.pydelhi.org/)
* [Hyderabad Conf](http://pyconf.hydpy.org/)
* [Pysangammam](https://pysangamam.org)

#### Meetups

Meetups are mini conference. Meetup helped me to connect with many interesting
people and I have learned most recent trends via Meetup events. The fun part of
Meetup is that Meetups are always arranged at different venue. Venue is
generally sponsored by tech company. You should take time and talk with the
available employees of the company. Meetup is the best place to step into their
premise and actually see their environment. I always hear announcements from
regarding openings at meetup.

This was a different case when I was living at Gandhinagar. There were a few
communities for sure, but it wasn't as diverse as what I am seeing at Bangalore.
I am sure this will be a situation at your hometown. I have seen people starting
Meetup if there isn't any in his/her town to create a community. Today benefit
of good network and support of community are standing with them as a success of
their efforts.

#### Events

Small events, mini conferences are a great way to connect with people. When I
mentored for [Django Girls]() Ahmadabad and Bangalore, I got connected with
awesome people. I was able to make a healthy relationship with them which helped
me in finding better opportunities and improving myself in many ways.

### Contract, Part-time

#### Incubation centers

Incubation centers has early staged startups. In my opinion, they are good place
to find contract based opportunities. I had never attracted by any job offers
for a full-time employment because of their low paying capabilities than an
established startup, but your preference may be different. Good incubation
center does events. You can go to their events, talk with the startups to know
more about their requirements. Things to be careful while choosing a contract
work is another matter to discuss, so I am skipping it here.

#### Co-working spaces

Co-working space are good choice for bit progressed startups. Good co-working
space arranges lot of events for startups. These events include hiring camps
too. In the past, I have got small contract based opportunities and weekend work
via network of co-working space. I try to maintain a healthy relationship with
the managers. I brief them regarding my technical expertise and request them to
keep me in mind whenever anyone is looking for any technical help in my domain.
You can try that too.

I will advise you to do a clear contract before starting any temporary work.
Contract has saved me once from over work and get paid for what I did.

### Remote (India friendly)

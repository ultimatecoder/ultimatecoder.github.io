## tl;dr

The conference is worth attending if you are a student, programmer or a
hobbyist.  If you are a swag-hungry then don't expect much as a swag from this
conference. If you are a Devsprint lover, then this conference has the coolest
Devsprint. A great number of keynote speackers are invited for this conference.


## Detailed Experience

Because I was volunteering for this conference I reached Pune one day earlier
than the conference days. The volunteer meeting was happening at Reserved-bit.

### Volunteer

#### Reserved-bit

[Reserved-bit][reservedbit] is the best hackerspace I have ever come across. It
has a large collection of programmable boards. You will find boards like
[Raspberry Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raspberry_Pi), [Bana
Pi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banana_Pi),
[Dragonboard](https://developer.qualcomm.com/hardware/dragonboard-410c),
[Bigalbon](https://www.bigalsmods.com/product-p/1001.htm),
[BBC-microbit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Micro_Bit) and the 3D printer.
Furthermore, this space has a great collection of books on Compilers and
Embedded programming. I managed to found few on open-source too. The owners are
great hackers. You will love to interact with hacker [Siddhesh
Poyarekar](https://siddhesh.in/). Hacker [Nisha
Poyarekar](https://twitter.com/nisha_poyarekar) is volunteering the [PyLadies
community](https://www.meetup.com/PyLadies-Pune/) at Pune.


#### Pune to Mumbai

I spent my half day in this space. I got the responsibility of receiving one of
the keynote speakers who was landing at Mumbai airport midnight. To be frank,
estimation of Google Maps between Pune to Mumbai is wrong. It showed nearly 2
hours but it took almost 4.5 hours to reach Mumbai. It took few more minutes to
reach the airport.  The road is impressively smooth. You will encounter the
beautiful mountains of [Lonavla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lonavla). The
task of moving from Pune to Mumbai airport, receive Katie and come back to Pune
was completed in almost 13 hours. I left from Pune around 4.30 PM and came back
at nearly 5 AM next day early morning.

#### Illness during conference

Because I did a huge amount of traveling at that night, I was unable to get
enough sleep. Such tiredness resulted in an eye infection. I managed to attend
the first day of the conference, but I was not in a condition to attend the
second day. Treatment from local doctor healed me in two days and then I was
able to take part into Devsprint.

### Conference

The conference was a total of 4 days where the initial two days were for the
talks and the end was assigned for a Devsprint. It didn't overwhelmed me with
many tracks but gave the quality talks presented in a single track. The talks
were set from 9 AM to 5 PM which was taken little lightly by the attendees.

I was pretty impressed with the keynote speakers of this conference.

#### [Katie Cunningham](https://twitter.com/kcunning)

Katie is the O'Reilly author. Her
[book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920024514.do) on Accessibility
depicts her area of expertise. She is fun to talk to. She likes to listen about
developer communities, writing and most importantly computer games. Her broad
vision on product development is amazing. She is an avid reader. I enjoyed
listening to her experience of being in India for the very first time.

#### [Honza Kral](https://twitter.com/honzakral)

Honza is the dude who loves contributing to
[Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). He is a core contributor of Django
too. He hacks on Python drivers at [Elastic](https://www.elastic.co/). I was
impressed with his suggestions on a code design problem I was trying to solve
from the past few months.  His suggestions on code design are worth noticing. He
is a vimmer and maintains little [vim](http://vim.org) plugins as a part of his
interest.

#### [Stephen J. Turnbull](https://twitter.com/yasegumi)

Stephen professes the Dismal Science of Economics. His knowledge is deep-rooted
just like his beard. You will enjoy discussing computer science, books and
his experience of programming. He is authoring few books written in the Japanese
language. Stephen is [Emacsite](https://www.gnu.org/s/emacs/).

#### [Terri Oda](https://twitter.com/terriko)

Terri is a security nerd. She spent most of her time exploring tools at Intel.
Terri knows how to hide from the spying of the U.S. Government. She is leading
[Google Summer of Code](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) section from
[Python Software Foundation](https://www.python.org/psf/). Terri is PSF
community service award winner. If you are a student and want to take part in
GSoC choosing PSF as your organization then she is the right person to talk to.

#### [Florian Fuchs](https://github.com/flofuchs)

His knowledge on [ReST
API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) construction
is the best. He is a [Falcon](https://falconframework.org/) nerd too. I enjoyed
discussing various authentication mechanisms for ReST API with him.  He is a
Red Hatter.

#### [Nick Coghlan](https://twitter.com/ncoghlan_dev)

Nick listens more than he speaks. I will advise you to not disturb him if he is
coding. He enjoys concentrating while coding. Getting his mentorship was a great
experience. He has been contributing to [Core
Python](https://github.com/python/cpython) for a few decades now.  You will
enjoy discussing on interesting code compositions with him. He is a Red Hatter.

#### [Praveen Patil](https://twitter.com/_gnovi)

Unfortunately, I didn't get much time to talk with Praveen during this
conference. He is a math teacher who teaches concepts of mathematics using
Python programming language. You should feel confident to speak with him on
Python in education and mathematics with him.


#### [John Hawley](https://github.com/warthog9)

John is the wittiest person that I know. His lines always end with humor. He
hacks mostly on hardware and GNU/Linux. Micro Python and GNU/Linux should be
considered as part of his interests.

I am sad to declare that I was unable to attend any keynote speeches because of
the illness. Mostly I rested at the hotel or talked with people during the
conference days.

#### Volunteer Party

If you are volunteering for this conference, then you will be invited to a
volunteer dinner party. We enjoyed party colored disco lights dancing on the
bits of the DJ. Punjabi food was served, and if you were above 25 than you were
allowed to take a sip of a beer.

#### Devsprint

Devsprint happen at the [Red Hat Headquarters,
Pune](https://goo.gl/maps/mXeirzQhPFz). I found the building has tight security.
You will find an individual pantry section dedicated to each department. We were
instructed to hack at a huge cafeteria section. I myself contributed to Core
Python. Nick Coghlan was mentoring for Core Python. I reviewed one PR, found one
broken test case and wrote a fix of an existing issue with his help.  Honza was
leading the development of Django web framework. A team of [Anand
Chitipothu](http://anandology.com/) mentored for [Web2py](www.web2py.com/).
[Farhaan Bukhsh](https://twitter.com/fhackdroid) mentored for
[Pagure](https://github.com/pypingou/pagure). John Hawley encouraged
contributing to [MicroPython](https://micropython.org/). Terr Oda, Stephen
Turnbull and Florian Fuchs mentored for
[GNU/Mailman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Mailman).

#### Why attend this conference?

* This conference has the coolest Devsprint. The organizers understand the value
  of the Devsprint in a conference. I have never observed such an importance of
  Devsprint at any other Python conference happening in India.

* If you are a student, then this is a beginner friendly conference. Don't be
  afraid to attend if you are a Python noob. You will receive a student
  concession for the tickets too.

* If you are a developer, coming to this conference will inspire you to grow
  from your present level. You will meet core contributors, lead programmers,
  owners of startups and project managers. You will find a huge scope of
  opportunities to network with people.

* The conference is single track event. This decision helped me to not miss the
  interesting talks. In my previous experience, parallel tracks forced me to
  choose between talks when I was interested in both, which killed me.

* I have never seen such a huge amount of keynote speakers at any conference
  happening in India. Keynote speakers were the main attraction of this
  conference.

#### What was missing?

* If you are a swag-hungry fellow than attending this conference won't be worth
  it. The conference attendees have to be satisfied with the conference T-shirt.

* I observed there were fewer corporate stalls than at other Python conferences.
  A stole from Reserved-bit, Red Hat and PSF community stall was there.

* A workshop section was completely missing. In my opinion, the workshop helps
  the beginners to start. There were a few topics which can be better
  represented as workshop rather than a talk.

* I was unable to observe any dedicated section for an open space discussion.
  This section is helpful for communities and contributors to discuss
  interesting problems and think together.
